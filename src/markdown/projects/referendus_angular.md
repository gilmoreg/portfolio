My first **Angular** project. I originally built this app using **jQuery** but the complexity of the code quickly multiplied and made it difficult to debug and reason about. I wanted to learn Angular and this project stuck out as a great candidate for a port.

I quickly taught myself Angular and the basics of **Typescript**, **ngrx**, and **reactive forms**. Ngrx was easy to learn given how similar it is to **Redux**. My biggest struggles were learning how to use **ngx-bootstrap** and how to manage state and events through its modals. They don't show up in **Augury** so debugging them is a pain point, but manageable.

While porting this app I also took the opportunity to clean up the back end. I switched the testing framework from Mocha to **Jest**, which I really like! I also refactored the code into an MVC pattern and used async/await for clarity in the code. Comparing this to my older code makes me feel great about how much I've grown as a developer!

**NOTE:** To see the original jQuery version of this app, see [here]("https://github.com/gilmoreg/referendus").
